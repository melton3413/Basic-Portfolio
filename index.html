                    <img class="headshot" src="./assets/images/marvel-ipsum.jpg" alt="Spider-Man">Well, here’s a fun little gem. You may have seen “lorem ipsum” text, or used it yourself, on a website. It’s often used as a placeholder text until the actual text needed for a page is ready. It’s a made-up language even though it bears some resemblance to Latin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There have been several variations in the lorem ipsum vein and one of the latest is Marvel Ipsum. Marvel Ipsum sets itself apart, like any good super hero would, by offering a few things out of the ordinary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any take on lorem ipsum will give you some paragraphs of text to work with. Marvel Ipsum is no different. You can choose the number of paragraphs, the number of sentences per paragraph, and which Marvel hero you’d like to highlight. There are nine heroes to choose from: Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine, Iron Man, Thor, Daredevil, Deadpool, Cyclops, or Captain America. Or just a random hero if you can’t choose between them. It also provides a nice “COPY” button as an alternative to highlighting the text and using keyboard commands to copy the output.
